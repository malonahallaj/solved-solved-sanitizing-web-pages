Search engines like Google have programs called web-scapers which visit webpages and scrape the information * displayed on the webpage. The displayable information is contained in html tags like p, table, h2 etc. * When we make a GET request for a webpage, the HTML that is returned can also contain tags like script which often * do not correspond to the displayable content on the webpage. Information inside script tags is not used by scapers * and they often ignore these tags in the HTML. Write a class called WebPageSanitizer which implements a static method * called String sanitize(String html) which removes all script tags and the information that they encapsulate and returns * a sanitized version of the HTML string. */
